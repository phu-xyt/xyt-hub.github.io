## Reporting issues

We use GitHub's integrated issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests.

If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please [search the issue tracker](https://github.com/xyt-hub/xyt-hub.github.io/search?type=Issues) to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn't already exist, [create a new issue](https://github.com/xyt-hub/xyt-hub.github.io/issues/new).
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use Markdown ``` escapes before and after your text.
